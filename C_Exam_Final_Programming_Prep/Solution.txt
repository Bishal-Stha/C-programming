Group A (2 × 10 Marks)
1. (10 Marks) Write a C program to input an integer array, find the largest and smallest elements in the array, and display their positions. Use functions for both input and computation.

2. (10 Marks) Explain how pointer arithmetic works in C. Write a program demonstrating pointer arithmetic to print the addresses and values of elements in a given integer array.

Group B (5 × 4 Marks)
1. (4 Marks) What are the different data types in C? Give examples of their usage in variable declarations.

2. (4 Marks) Explain the difference between a while loop and a do while loop with an example.

3. (4 Marks) Define a structure in C to store details of a book (title, author, and price). Write a code snippet to input and display the details of three books.

4. (4 Marks) What is the purpose of the  and  functions in C? Write a simple program to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for an integer.

=>There are different datatypes in c programming. Some of them are int, float, char, bool, long, double, etc. 
int datatype is used to store variable that are integer, float datatype is used to store variable that are of floating point numbers, char is used to store character value, bool is used to store true or false value.
data types and their format specifier.
int -> %d
float -> %f
char -> %c

#include<stdio.h>
int main()

{
    int a =10;
    char gender = 'M';
    float pi = 3.1415;

    printf("a is %d\t gender is %c and pi is %f\n",a,gender,pi);

=> do while and while loops are types of loops in c programming language. They might sound and function similar but they have some differences.
