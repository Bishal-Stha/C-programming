Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA):
functions are:
1. malloc() - memory allocation
2. calloc() - contagious allocation
3. realloc()
4. free()


In C, malloc allocates a single block of memory of a specified size, leaving the memory uninitialized (containing garbage values), while calloc allocates multiple blocks of memory, each of a specified size, and initializes all allocated memory to zero. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown: 
malloc():
Allocates a single block of memory.
Takes one argument: the number of bytes to allocate.
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory, or NULL if allocation fails.
The allocated memory is not initialized, meaning it contains arbitrary values (garbage).
calloc():
Allocates multiple blocks of memory, each of a specified size.
Takes two arguments: the number of elements to allocate and the size of each element (in bytes).
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory, or NULL if allocation fails.
The allocated memory is initialized to zero.
In essence: 
Use malloc() when you want to allocate a single block of memory and don't need the memory initialized to zero.
Use calloc() when you want to allocate multiple blocks of memory and need them initialized to zero.
